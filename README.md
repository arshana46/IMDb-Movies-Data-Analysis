# IMDb-Movies-Data-Analysis
A Python data analysis project on IMDb movie dataset using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### Objective
Analyze IMDb movie data to uncover trends in **ratings, duration, metascore, and audience preferences** using Python.

### Tools
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn

###  Key Highlights
- Strong correlation between **IMDb Rating** and **Metascore**  
- **Movie duration** has little effect on ratings 
- Older films and **18+ movies** often have higher ratings   
- Data cleaned: handled missing values, duplicates, and converted durations  

###  Visualization
Correlation heatmaps and charts provide clear insights into movie trends and audience behavior.

## Streamlit Deployment

I deployed this project as an interactive Streamlit app to make the analysis more engaging and user-friendly.

## What I implemented:

Interactive filters: Users can filter movies by year range, IMDb rating range, and age rating using the sidebar.

Dynamic table display: The filtered movies are shown in a table inside the app, making it easy to explore the dataset.

Charts and visualizations: All the charts (distribution of IMDb ratings, average rating by year, movie duration vs rating, correlation heatmap, Metascore vs IMDb rating) are saved as images and displayed interactively in the app.

Key insights section: Important findings, like correlations and trends, are highlighted directly in the app for quick understanding.

Background image and styling: Added a custom background image and styled the app to make it visually appealing.
